# Image-Search-Engine
---
Description
The Image Search Engine is a simple web application that allows users to search for images based on a keyword. Built primarily with JavaScript, this project demonstrates the use of APIs to fetch and display image results dynamically.

While the app focuses on functionality and dynamic interaction, less emphasis has been placed on CSS design and responsiveness, making it more suited for desktop use.
